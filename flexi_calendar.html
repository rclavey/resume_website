        <h1>Flexi Calendar</h1>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>In this project, I developed a calendar app specifically designed for myself and my coworkers. As a police officer, our schedule is not fixed to a seven-day week, which makes it difficult to plan ahead. This inspired me to create an app that helps keep track of our unique schedule, making it easier for us to manage our time and coordinate with each other.</p>

        <p>I used the Swift programming language to build this app and launched it on the Apple App Store. While there were other apps available that offered similar functionality, I found them lacking in terms of user experience and design. Additionally, many of these apps placed certain essential features behind a paywall, which I wanted to avoid in my own app.</p>

        <p>My calendar app features a clean, user-friendly interface that allows users to easily input and track their shifts. The app is designed to accommodate our non-standard schedule, providing a flexible and intuitive way to manage our workdays. </p>

        <p>By focusing on the specific needs of police officers and other professionals with irregular schedules, I was able to create a tool that significantly improves our ability to plan ahead and stay organized. The app is free to use and does not hide any features behind a paywall, ensuring that all users have access to its full functionality.</p>
