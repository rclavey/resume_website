        <h1>Real Expense</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>When my brother, a realtor, came up with a solution to a common industry problem I was able to turn this idea into a reality, and that reality has become Real Expense. Real Expense is a comprehensive expense tracking app developed to address the specific needs of professionals managing deductible expenses. Users can log in securely through Apple ID, ensuring a smooth authentication process, while also providing an option for guest logins. The app allows users to create and manage profiles, including the ability to log out of their accounts when needed.</p>

<p>One of the core features of Real Expense is its robust expense tracking and management capabilities. Users can add new expenses by specifying details such as the amount, date, name, notes, category, and receipt images. The app supports image uploads for receipts, enhancing record-keeping accuracy. Additionally, users can edit existing expenses to update any details, ensuring flexibility and accuracy in maintaining records.</p>

<p>Category management is made easy with dynamic category sorting, which places the most recently used categories at the top of the list when adding new expenses. This feature enhances user convenience by allowing quick access to frequently used categories. Each expense category is also assigned a fixed color in the pie chart, providing visual consistency and making it easier for users to recognize categories at a glance.</p>

<p>Real Expense offers detailed expense visualization through a pie chart view, which provides a clear and concise overview of how expenses are distributed across different categories. In addition to the pie chart, users can view a list of categories with their respective totals, sorted in descending order of expense amount. This dual-view approach ensures users can quickly and easily understand their spending patterns.</p>

<p>To facilitate detailed analysis, the app includes a time range selector that allows users to filter expenses based on different time ranges, including all time, year-to-date, last year, and a specific year. For more detailed analysis, users can select a specific year using a picker, allowing them to drill down into their expenses for any given year. This time-based filtering is available in both the pie chart and list views, providing comprehensive insights into spending habits over time.</p>

<p>The app also offers robust export and print options. Users can generate a PDF of their expenses, which includes all relevant details and can be printed directly from the app. The PDF export supports different time ranges for customized reports. Additionally, users can export their expenses as a CSV file, making it easy to import the data into other applications for further analysis or record-keeping.</p>

<p>The user interface of Real Expense is designed for ease of use and intuitive navigation. Segmented pickers are used for selecting time ranges, providing a user-friendly interface. When selecting a specific year, a wheel picker is employed, offering a familiar and easy-to-use interface for year selection. The app utilizes a navigation view and forms to organize different sections, ensuring a clean and organized layout.</p>

<p>Overall, Real Expense is a powerful and comprehensive tool designed to streamline the process of tracking and managing expenses. With secure authentication, flexible expense addition and editing, dynamic category management, detailed visualization, and robust export options, it is an invaluable tool for personal or business finance management. Advanced features such as fixed category colors, recent category sorting, and detailed time-based filtering further enhance its usability, making it an essential app for anyone looking to efficiently manage their expenses.</p>
